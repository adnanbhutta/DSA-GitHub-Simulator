## 🚀 How To Run

### 1. Open the Project in Your C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, DevC++, VSCode)
### 2. Compile `src/main.cpp`
### 3. Run the Executable

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Each user can:
- **Create repositories**
- **Add files** to those repos
- **Commit** new versions
- **Fork** repositories from others
- **Comment** on files
- **Follow/unfollow** other users

All data is saved and loaded from `.csv` files for persistence.
